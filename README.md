# deep learning and neural network

bjective:

Train a neural network to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as positive or negative.

Dataset:

The dataset contains movie reviews with corresponding sentiments (positive or negative).
It's stored in a file named 'IMDB Dataset.csv'.

Instructions

Tools and Libraries Required:

Python
Pandas for data handling
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
NLTK for text preprocessing
Scikit-learn for machine learning utilities
TensorFlow/Keras for building and training neural network models
Steps:

Data Loading and Exploration:
 
Load the data using Pandas.
Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of sentiments, the length of reviews, and other characteristics.
 
Data Preprocessing:
 
Convert all reviews to lower case.
Remove HTML tags and URLs from reviews.
Tokenize the text and remove stop words.
Use TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into a format suitable for input into the neural network.
 
Model Building:
 
Construct a Sequential model with Dense layers:
First layer: Dense, ReLU activation (input dimension should match the number of features from TF-IDF).
Hidden layers: experiment with different sizes and activations.
Output layer: Dense, Sigmoid activation (binary classification).
Compile the model with binary crossentropy loss and accuracy metrics.
 
Model Training:
 
Train the model using the training set.
Use a validation split to monitor performance on unseen data during training.
Adjust parameters like the number of epochs and batch size as needed.
 
Evaluation:
 
Evaluate the model on a separate test set to assess its performance.
Use metrics such as accuracy and loss.
 
Visualization:
 
Plot training and validation loss over epochs.
Plot training and validation accuracy over epochs.
 
Report:
 
Provide insights gained from the project.
Discuss any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
Suggest potential improvements for the model or preprocessing steps.
